The product is a multi-tenant cloud native platform for product data syndication, where vendors and retailers effortlessly can exchange detailed product information. We are working with large multi-dimensional data sets, and complex meta-specified data models, which means that we have interesting algorithmic problems to solve.


The team

The PDX team is a dedicated, autonomous group of developers within Stibo Systems. We consist of 25 development resources split between the development offices in Denmark, Poland and US and a similar sized group of business people. As a small generic development team, we can discuss and implement the technologies we consider suitable, and we are open to your ideas.


Technologies includes

We develop the microservices using Java 11, Spring Boot 2, and Spring Cloud, where we define, generate, and document the APIs using Swagger. We build with Gradle, and provision using Terraform, Ansible, and Python. The solution is running in AWS using Docker containers. Besides that, we use technologies like:
Database: RIAK, Cassandra, PostgreSQL
Searching: Elasticsearch.
Event queue: Kafka
Monitoring: Loki, JÃ¤ger, Prometheus
Continuous integration: Jenkins Pipelines
Source control: Bitbucket/git
UI: Angular and TypeScript.


We work in Scrum teams with dedicated front-end, back-end, DevOps, and QA responsibilities. However, we do prefer a good understanding of the other roles, and we expect most back-end developers to be able to participate in DevOps tasks.
